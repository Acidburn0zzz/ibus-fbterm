.SH "KEY BINDING"
The recent ibus\-fbterm no longer uses the protocol of fbterm because
fbterm would bind Control\-space focibly and now the private header files
are not used to communicate between fbterm and ibus\-fbterm\-backend.

.PP
The default keybinding is Super\-space to switch ibus engines.
Most keybdings would not work due to VT100 keybindings.
Super\-space and Control\-space are tested to work fine.
The Super\-space switches the first two IMEs only.  To show 
IBus IME switcher panel is \fBdouble\fR Super\-space keys.
The reverse switching keybinding is Escape and Super\-space keys.
Shift\-Super\-space would not work due to VT100 keybindings and
Escape key is used for the Shift binding in ibus\-fbterm.
